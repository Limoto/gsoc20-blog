My name is Jakub Luzny and I’m a Master's student of Computer Science at Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic. I was accepted into Google Summer of Code program to work on a project named “Porting of Jailhouse partitioning hypervisor into Automotive Grade Linux (AGL)”. My mentor is Jan-Simon Möller (dl9pf).

In this blog, I'm going to write about my progress on the project.
